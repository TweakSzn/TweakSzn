# TweakerCentral
I live in Texas and am 18 :D
I like skateboarding, making things, music,  and wrestling.
One fun fact about myself is that I know how to make 3D Models in blender 
My favorite class is computer science 3 because I get to talk with like minded people about things like Chembun and game development.
